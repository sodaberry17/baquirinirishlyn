        <h2>History</h2>
        <div class="frame-content">
            <p>In the aftermath of the Great War, the world began to heal, but Violet Evergarden struggled to find her place. A former child soldier, her purpose had always been defined by orders and battle. Now, with the war over, she sought a new meaning to her life.</p>
            <p>Violet found herself employed at the CH Postal Company as an Auto Memory Doll, writing letters for those who couldn't express their feelings in words. Her first assignment took her to a small, seaside village where she met a young woman named Clara. Clara had lost her husband in the war, and though she received his final letter, she couldn't bring herself to write back.</p>
            <p>Violet, with her mechanical arms and stoic demeanor, was an unusual sight in the village. Yet, as she patiently listened to Clara's story, she began to understand the depth of human emotions. Clara spoke of her husband, their dreams, and the life they had planned together. Violet's heart, once hardened by the battlefield, softened as she transcribed Clara's words into a heartfelt letter.</p>
            <p>As she wrote, Violet recalled her own past, her commanding officer Major Gilbert, and the words he left her with: "I love you." She had never understood their meaning, but through Clara's grief and love, she began to grasp the weight of those words.</p>
            <p>The letter was sent, and Clara found a sense of closure. She thanked Violet, who realized that her new mission was to connect hearts and bridge the gaps left by the war. Each letter she wrote brought her closer to understanding herself and the emotions she had long suppressed.</p>
            <p>Violet Evergarden continued her journey, not as a weapon of war, but as a bearer of emotions, learning that every letter she crafted was a step toward healing her own heart.</p>
