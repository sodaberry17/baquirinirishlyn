        <h2>The Golden Touch</h2>

        <p>There once was a king named Midas who did a good deed for a satyr — a spirit of nature. Dionysus, the god of wine, then granted him a wish.
            For his wish, Midas asked that whatever he touched would turn to gold. Despite Dionysus’ efforts to prevent it, Midas pleaded that this was a fantastic wish, so it was bestowed.
            Excited about his newly-earned powers, Midas started touching all kinds of things, turning each item into pure gold.
            But soon, Midas became hungry. As he picked up a piece of food, he found he couldn’t eat it. It had turned to gold in his hand.
            Hungry, Midas groaned, “I’ll starve! Perhaps this was not such an excellent wish after all!”
            Seeing his dismay, Midas’ beloved daughter threw her arms around him to comfort him, and she, too, turned to gold. “The golden touch is no blessing,” Midas cried.</p>

        <h2>The Fox and the Grapes</h2>

        <p>One day, a fox became very hungry. He went out to search for some food. He searched high and low but couldn’t find anything to eat.
            Finally, as his stomach rumbled, he stumbled upon a farmer’s wall. At the top of the wall, he saw the biggest, juiciest grapes he’d ever seen. They were a rich purple, telling the fox they were ready to be eaten.
            To reach the grapes, the fox had to jump high in the air. As he jumped, he opened his mouth to catch the grapes, but he missed. The fox tried again but missed once more. He tried a few more times but kept failing.
            Finally, the fox decided to give up and go home. While he walked away, he muttered, “I’m sure the grapes were sour anyway.”</p>

        <h2>The Proud Rose</h2>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/28/14/4a/28144a641b90ad710709ade80a1df789.jpg" alt="Right Frame Image">
        <p>Once upon a time, in a desert far away, there was a rose who was so proud of her beautiful looks. Her only complaint was that she was growing next to an ugly cactus.
            Every day, the beautiful rose would insult and mock the cactus about his looks, all while the cactus remained quiet. All the other plants nearby tried to make the rose see sense, but she was too swayed by her own looks.
            One scorching summer, the desert became dry, and there was no water left for the plants. The rose quickly began to wilt. Her beautiful petals dried up, losing their lush color.
            Looking to the cactus, she saw a sparrow dip his beak into the cactus to drink some water. Though ashamed, the rose asked the cactus if she could have some water. The kind cactus readily agreed, helping them both through the tough summer as friends.</p>
